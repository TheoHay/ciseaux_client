Rust 1.39 and tokio required !

Just an asynchronous Redis Pool implementation I did for personnal use, not sure if it is reliable and safe to use (There is no unsafe here, but the pool management is really basic).

This crate is (probably) NOT PRODUCTION READY, I have no experience, if you want to use it in personnal or professional projet, please check the code first.
